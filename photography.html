								<p>Pictures shown above are of my family heritage. A large container full of printed photos caught my eye during a visit with my grandparents. I asked if they had backups and when the last time they looked at them since their move. They were the originals and they couldn't remember the last time they sat and dove into the collection. Having recently bought a document scanner, I asked if I could digitize them. I didn't know at the time, that this is where my calling for photography started. I took it on in hopes to preserve and learn more about my ancestors.

								<h3>Hampton Studio</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>My grandfather owned a portrait studio that lasted until the one hour photo processing was debuting. I remembered having my photo taken as a child there but it didn't occur to me until later how invested he was into portraits or how long he had been in the profession.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>After experiencing his reactions to reliving those memories that could be organized and played on a slideshow right in front of him, I was inspired to continue doing this and also to start taking my own photos. He taught me about exposure, depth of field and lighting subjects. I taught him about cloud storage and photo editing software.</p>
								<h3>Weddings</h3>
								I took the opposite of a sales approach to weddings and volunteered services for each. I would only shoot for friends and family. I learned a pretty hard lesson about shooting and editing after coming home with over 10k raw images. Just because you have the space, and can get 10 images a second, doesn't mean you should. I learned to assist with creating the moments that people were looking for and also being exactly where I needed to be to efficiently capture the story I wanted to tell.</p>
